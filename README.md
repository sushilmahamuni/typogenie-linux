## ‚ú® What is TypoGenie?

TypoGenie runs in the background, monitoring your clipboard.  
When you copy text (Ctrl+C), it automatically:
- Fixes grammar and spelling using AI
- Replaces the clipboard with the improved version
- Lets you paste cleaner, smarter text (Ctrl+V)

It's like having a personal AI genie at your fingertips. üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
